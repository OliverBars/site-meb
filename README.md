Technologies used in development:

SCSS (Sass): A popular CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of CSS, allowing
for variables, mixins, and other features to make CSS coding more efficient and maintainable.

Gulp: A task runner/build system that automates repetitive tasks in the development workflow, such 
as compiling SCSS to CSS, minifying files, and optimizing images.

Desktop-first approach: A design and development approach where the initial focus is on designing and developing 
for desktop or larger screen sizes, and then adapting the layout and design for smaller screens, such as mobile devices or 
tablets.

JavaScript: A widely used programming language that allows for dynamic and interactive content on web pages. 
Libraries and plugins such as jQuery, noUiSlider, Slick Slider, and Renge Slider were used for additional functionality.


Responsive design: A design approach that ensures web pages display properly on various devices and screen sizes, including 
desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. This involves using media queries, fluid grid systems, and other techniques to create a consistent user experience 
across different devices.
